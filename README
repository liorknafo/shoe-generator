# Shoe Generator

This repository contains a command-line utility that scales a 3D shoe STL to match a user's foot size using a photograph.

## Usage

```
python foot_to_shoe.py --image foot.jpg --foot-length-mm 270 --stl shoe.stl --output scaled_shoe.stl
```

The program will:

1. Detect the heel and big toe in the image and measure the distance between them in pixels.
2. Use the provided real foot length to compute a millimetres-per-pixel ratio.
3. Estimate foot width and scale the STL's length and width accordingly.
4. Rotate the model to match the foot's orientation and save the scaled STL.

Dependencies: `opencv-python`, `numpy`, and `numpy-stl`.
